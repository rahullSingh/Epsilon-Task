# Epsilon-Task
Part 1
Differences:

1ST:
  IN UI specs border-radius was given 1 BUT,
  IN THE CODED RESULT border-radius was given 4.
  
2ND:
  IN UI specs I don't find any border-width But,
  IN THE CODED RESULT border-with was given 1px.
  
3RD:
  IN UI specs CardHeader font-size is given 15px BUT,
  IN THE CODED RESULT font-size is given 18px.
  
 4TH:
  IN UI specs CardHeader hover state (Beach Day text) It is not underlined BUT,
  IN THE CODED RESULT CardHeader hover state (Beach Day text) It is underlined.
  
  Generally we use underline text decoration for links.
  
  5TH:
   IN UI specs CardDescription(REFUS THE DOG) font-weight is given BOLD(700) BUT,
   IN THE CODED RESULT CardDescription(REFUS THE DOG) font-weight is given 800.
   
  6TH:
   IN THE CODED RESULT It is additionally added margin-bottom:14px for "cardDate" But,
   margin-bottom:14px is already added in "card" Component so, reusuing same
   property for "cardDate" component is not necessary.
   
  7TH:
   IN UI specs "Card" Hover state "cardDate" is visible BUT,
   IN THE CODED RESULT "cardDate" is not visible.
   
  8TH:
    IN UI specs "cardDate" hover state opacity is low;
    IN THE CODED RESULT opacity is high(i.e opacity:1).
    
  9TH:
    IN UI specs "Card" Hover state I don't find any background color BUT,
    IN THE CODED RESULT background color is given.
    
  10TH:
    IN UI specs "Card" Hover state dropshadow opacity is 60% BUT,
    IN THE CODED RESULT dropshadow opacity is 90%.
    
  11TH:
     IN UI specs I don't find any "card" component border BUT,
     IN THE CODED RESULT It is given 1 px.
     
  12TH:
    IN UI specs "REFFUS THE DOG" is in Capital form But,
    IN THE CODED RESULT it is small(Refus the Dog).
    
    
  Improvements:
     =>I think the "cardDescriptions" text "REFUS THE DOG" should have 2 f's in REFUS, i.e it should be "REFFUS THE DOG".
